# matter-rpi4-nRF52840-dongle

This project is a walk-through of [building with Matter](https://buildwithmatter.com/)!  The walk-through is available on this project's [GitHub Pages](http://caubut-charter.github.io/matter-rpi4-nRF52840-dongle/).

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a guided walk-through for building, commissioning, and testing Matter accessories.  [nRF52840 Dongles](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-Dongle/GetStarted) are used as low-cost radios and microcontrollers.  A [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) is used for providing services.  Building and flashing firmware images can be done on a Linux Desktop or directly on the Raspberry Pi.  *Every* stage is Dockerized to prevent dependency issues on the host.
